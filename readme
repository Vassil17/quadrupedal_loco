This is a general framework for legged robots- ros_gazebo simulation (taking the unitree gol for example)

Put "unitree_ros" under your catkin workspace "src/" dir, then "catkin_make" will work ....

Before starting, we should
(1) Add catkin dependency, please make sure you already have successfully tested the "unitree_ros" repo in "https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros".
(2) Install C++ optimization library "Mosek", following a guide from "https://docs.mosek.com/latest/cxxfusion/index.html". 
Mosek 9 should work (downloaded from "https://www.mosek.com/downloads/list/9/")

Also, replace the mosek library directory in "" by your own location.  
(3) Install c++ matrix armadillo:

    sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
    sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
    sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
    sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev


After that, you can test the quadrupedal locomotion by:
(1) 'caktin_make'
(2) 'source devel/setup.bash'
(3) load gazebo simulator using GO1 desription: 'roslaunch unitree_gazebo normal.launch rname:=go1 wname:=empty' (Motion planning nodes also start at the same time)
(4) test the locomotion: 'rosrun rosrun go1_rt_control go1_servo'
